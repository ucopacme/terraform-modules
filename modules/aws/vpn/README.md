| customer\_gateway\_ip\_address | The IP address of the gateway's Internet-routable external interface | `string` | n/a | yes |
| enabled | Set to `false` to prevent the module from creating any resources | `string` | `"true"` | no |
| name | Resource name | `string` | n/a | yes |
| route\_table\_ids | The IDs of the route tables for which routes from the Virtual Private Gateway will be propagated | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |

| vpn\_connection\_tunnel2\_inside\_cidr | The CIDR block of the inside IP addresses for the second VPN tunnel | `string` | `null` | no |
| vpn\_connection\_tunnel2\_preshared\_key | The preshared key of the second VPN tunnel. The preshared key must be between 8 and 64 characters in length and cannot start with zero. Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters, periods(.) and underscores(\_) | `string` | `null` | no |
| vpn\_gateway\_amazon\_side\_asn | The Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the VPN gateway. If you don't specify an ASN, the Virtual Private Gateway is created with the default ASN | `number` | `64512` | no |
